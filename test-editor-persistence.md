# Testing Editor Tab State Persistence

## Issue
The editor tab was not properly persisting its state (opened file, cursor position, etc.) when navigating away from a session and back.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `SessionView.tsx` where panels were only loaded from the database if there were no panels in memory (`existingPanels.length === 0`). This meant that when switching between sessions, the stale in-memory state was used instead of loading the latest saved state from the database.

## Fix Applied
Modified `SessionView.tsx` to always reload panels from the database when switching sessions, ensuring we get the latest saved state.

### Changed Code
In `frontend/src/components/SessionView.tsx`:
- Removed the check for `existingPanels.length === 0`
- Now always calls `panelApi.loadPanelsForSession()` when the active session changes
- Removed `panels` from the useEffect dependencies to avoid skipping the reload

## Test Plan
1. Open Crystal app
2. Navigate to a session with an editor panel
3. Open a file in the editor
4. Scroll down and place cursor at a specific position
5. Switch to another session
6. Switch back to the original session
7. **Expected**: The editor should still show the same file, at the same scroll position, with cursor at the same location
8. **Previous behavior**: The editor would forget what file was open

## Implementation Details
The EditorPanel component already properly saves state to the database via the `panelApi.updatePanel()` calls, including:
- `filePath`: Current file being edited
- `cursorPosition`: Current cursor position
- `scrollPosition`: Current scroll position
- `isDirty`: Whether file has unsaved changes
- `expandedDirs`: File tree expanded directories
- `searchQuery`: File tree search query
- `showSearch`: File tree search visibility
- `fileTreeWidth`: Width of the file tree panel

All of this state is now properly restored when switching between sessions.
